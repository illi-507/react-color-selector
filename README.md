This ReactJS project is inspired from "https://flatuicolors.com/" where developers can easly look for catchy & soothing colors to use in their project. I highly imitate its basic layout and make my own
color selector.
Techs:
1. Reuse of React UI components
2. Pass argument from one component to the other component by using "props" from ReactJS.
3. Implement copy text(color hex) to clipboard by clicking a button.

Furthermore, this project also demonstrates how to deploy the web app to netlify and host the app.
